<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi!I'm Raga Bhamidipati, a 20-year-old, soon to turn 21 this January, currently navigating the world of academia as
   a university student. Hailing from a background in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, i've been deeply immersed in
  major, blending a love for technology with an insatiable curiosity for the future.My journey
  in AIML is not just a path of education but a passion I embraces wholeheartedly.</p>

<p> One of my simple joys is the companionship of a good book and the warmth of a well-brewed cup of coffee. 
  An avid reader, i've found solace in the pages of "A Hundred Little Flames" by Preeti Shenoy and
  "In Order to Live" by Yeonmi Park, each narrative leaving an indelible mark on her perspective.
  My love for literature is not just a pastime; it's a gateway to different worlds, offering me a retreat in the realm of words.     </p>

<p>Embracing my introverted nature,I thrive in solitude, finding beauty and tranquility in my own company.
  My MBTI personality type, INFJ-T, reflects a unique blend of intuition, empathy, and a penchant for introspection.
  I believes in the power of deep, meaningful connections and places a high value on genuine friendships, considering
  them as treasures in the tapestry of my life.</p>

  <p>While I appreciate the finer things in life, I hold a particular fondness for the concept of friendship, valuing 
  the bonds I've cultivated along my journey. As a young enthusiast, I not only enjoy the pursuit of knowledge in my
  academic endeavors but also relishes the luxury of introspective moments and the simple pleasures that enrich my
  everyday experiences.</p>
